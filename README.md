Learning Cairo &amp; Starknet contracts | tea farmer #420 to #1 
**Day 1 - 18 Nov 2025** Set up Starknet dev environment and wrote first Hello World in Cairo | Streak 1/100 ☕ #tea #Starknet

**Day 2 - 19 Nov 2025** Explored Cairo syntax basics and tested simple variables/storage | Streak 2/100 🫖 #tea #Starknet

**Day 3 - 20 Nov 2025** Cairo storage + simple contract tested | Streak 3/100 ☕ #tea #Starknet

**Day 4 - 21 Nov 2025** Cairo functions explored + contract deployment tested | Streak 4/100 🫖 #tea #Starknet

**Day 5 - 22 Nov 2025** Built and deployed a basic Cairo event-emitting contract on Starknet testnet, optimizing for storage efficiency | Streak 5/100 ☕ #TeaProtocol #Starknet #CairoLang #OSSImpact #AirdropRewardsDay 6 - 23 Nov 2025 Explored mappings and key-value storage in Cairo contracts, integrated into a test contract | Streak 6/100  #TeaProtocol #Starknet #CairoLang #OSSImpact #AirdropRewardsDay 7 - 24 Nov 2025 Learned about structs and enums in Cairo, built and deployed a sample contract using them on testnet | Streak 7/100  #TeaProtocol #Starknet #CairoLang #OSSImpact #AirdropRewards

Day 8 - 25 Nov 2025: Explored arrays, loops in Cairo; deployed iterative contract on testnet | Streak 8/100 #TeaProtocol #Starknet #CairoLang #OSSImpact #AirdropRewards
Day 9 - 26 Nov 2025: Explored conditionals, if-else, and match in Cairo; deployed decision-logic contract on testnet | Streak 9/100  #TeaProtocol #Starknet #CairoLang #OSImpact #AirdropRewards

Day 10 - 27 Nov 2025: Explored functions and recursion in Cairo; deployed a recursive logic contract on testnet | Streak 10/100  #TeaProtocol #Starknet #CairoLang #OSSImpact #AirdropRewards
